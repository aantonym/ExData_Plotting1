## Notes on running the Assignment scripts

The four R scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and plot4.R) have only one dependancy: They require the file "household_power_consumption.txt" in the same folder. No special libraries need to be loaded, nor arguments passed.Absence of the input file will return an error message.

Instructions to run plot1.R are as below (may be used for remaining scripts, by changing 1 in the source file name and function to 2, 3, or 4):
At command line, enter the following:
>> source("plot1.R")

>>plot1()

This will result in a png file called plot1.png to be created in the same directory.


### Note:

The input file could not be uploaded, due to size (it is over 100MB)
